### Component Descriptions

1. **Frontend (Next.js)**
   - Provides a responsive and interactive user interface for browsing products, managing orders, and handling user authentication.
   - Fetches and displays data from the backend APIs in real-time.

2. **Clerk Authentication**
   - **Purpose:** Secure user authentication and session management.
   - **Integration:** Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles securely.
   - **Flow:**
     1. User signs up or logs in via Clerk.
     2. Clerk manages user sessions and provides user data to the frontend.
     3. User data is stored securely in Clerk's database.

3. **Mock API for Product Data**
   - **Purpose:** Simulate product data for initial development and testing.
   - **Integration:**
     1. Mock API provides product data (name, price, stock, images, etc.).
     2. Data is later migrated to Sanity CMS for production.

4. **Sanity CMS for Product and Inventory Management**
   - **Purpose:** Centralized backend for managing product data, inventory, and orders.
   - **Integration:**
     1. Product data is stored in Sanity CMS.
     2. Real-time inventory updates are managed via Sanity.
     3. Stock levels are dynamically updated based on user purchases.

5. **Stripe Payment Gateway**
   - **Purpose:** Secure payment processing for user orders.
   - **Integration:**
     1. User proceeds to checkout and enters payment details.
     2. Stripe processes the payment and confirms the transaction.
     3. On successful payment, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page.

6. **ShipEngine for Shipment Tracking and Label Generation**
   - **Purpose:** Generate shipping labels and provide real-time shipment tracking.
   - **Integration:**
     1. After payment, the user is directed to a page to enter shipping details.
     2. ShipEngine generates a shipping label and tracking number.
     3. The user can track their order in real-time using the tracking number.

## Key Workflows

1. **User Registration and Authentication**
   1. User signs up or logs in via Clerk.
   2. Clerk manages user sessions and provides user data to the frontend.
   3. User data is stored securely in Clerk's database.

2. **Product Browsing and Inventory Management**
   1. User browses products on the frontend.
   2. Product data is fetched from the Mock API (later Sanity CMS).
   3. Real-time inventory updates are displayed based on stock levels.
   4. Out-of-stock products are added to the wishlist, while in-stock products can be added to the cart.

3. **Order Placement and Payment Processing**
   1. User adds products to the cart and proceeds to checkout.
   2. Stripe processes the payment and confirms the transaction.
   3. On successful payment, the user is redirected to an order confirmation page.

4. **Shipment Tracking and Label Generation**
   1. After payment, the user enters shipping details.
   2. ShipEngine generates a shipping label and tracking number.
   3. The user can track their order in real-time using the tracking number.
